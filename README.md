## Description

#### push swap is a program that sorts different numbers using few instructions to move the numbers with optimized number of moves using two stacks only. The numbers that are allowed to be sorted in this program are between the max int and the minimum int. The limited instructions that are used to solve this sorting are:

- sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.

- sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.

- pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.

- pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.

- ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

- rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

- rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.

- rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
